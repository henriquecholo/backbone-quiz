backbone-quiz
=============

Quiz built in BackboneJS and Underscore.

You will probably need a Apache or any other "localhost" provider because the XmlHttpRequest made to access the JSON data doesn't work on a path sctructure request.

After that, you can just put all the folders and files in the directory described (eg var/www/)and be fun!

PS: You may consider changing the JSON data to create your own questions. Don't forget to change the answer JSON also. I separate them for security.

Thank you.
